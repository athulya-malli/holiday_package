# Project: Holiday Package prediction

Analysis: Concepts of logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis were tested to predict if a person will opt for the holiday package or not.

Outcome: Foreign employees, and employees without children, have higher chances of opting for holiday. It is observed that employees opting for holiday package is inversely correlated to higher number of children due to costs.

Business decision: Holiday packages can be modified to make infant and young children friendly to attract more employees having young children. Family packages can be introduced at a better price point. Special discounts, or budget packages at less expensive hotels can increase the business.
